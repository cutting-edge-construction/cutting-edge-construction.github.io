              <h4>David Hooks</h4>
              <p class="text-muted">
                David Hooks has been building since he was old enough to hold a hammer and not hurt himself. He was raised, along with his five siblings, in a 220 year old rambling farm house in western Massachusetts. This old house was in need of constant attention. His father, Kelly, was forever rebuilding or remodeling one room or another. David literally cut his teeth chewing tooth picks made from Rock Maple – originally milled in the 1780’s – while remodeling a bathroom. From there David moved on to help his dad build a new home which took place from 1979 through 1981. Aside from a wide array of skills acquired from these experiences, David also came away with a solid work ethic. After moving to Santa Cruz in 1983, David continued to expand his knowledge and skills working for other builders and tradesmen. Today he enjoys a strong reputation as a contractor with high standards and attention to detail.

                  <h4>Borgman Project</h4>
                  <p>I have been happy to hire and rehire David Hooks Construction to fulfill my remodelling needs many times over the last ten years. David has proven to be adept at many different kinds of projects. He always brings in the right team of skilled craftsmen to execute the job. In 1996 he oversaw the complete remodel of our company, Preston Wynne Spas, in Saratoga. This job was very complex, involving three bathrooms, eight treatment rooms and the lobby. Although all remodel projects are prone to the occasional problem, David was able to resolve all of them efficiently and professionally and complete the job on schedule. Then again in 1998 we hired David to build our new corporate offices in Saratoga, and again they came through for us. In 2001 I was confident to put them to the task of remodelling my entire home; kitchen, two bathrooms, dining room, living room and two bedrooms. The results were spectacular! Although that home has since been sold, the improvements made to it were the biggest factor in getting an above-asking-price offer. We have always been happy to work with David and his team, and look forward to the next opportunity to do it again.

                                    <h4>Leonard Project</h4>
                  <p>In 2005 we hired David Hooks Construction Services to build an addition to our home on the West side of Santa Cruz. At the advice of our architect we decided to get three bids for this project. The prices came in within $40,000 of each other, and David’s was not the lowest. As we drilled into the details of each proposal it became very clear that many important construction elements were not included in all the bids. Further more, the presentation of information was often difficult to decipher in each of the different documents. This is where David’s proposal rose to the top. It was the clearly the most concise and well written document in the group. When discussing the project David understood how all elements of the job were going to happen and he was well versed in all its little details. Also, his references were of the highest order. We are happy to add our names to his list of referrals and would recommend him to anyone considering doing remodel work.

                                    <h4>Pearson Project</h4>
                  <p>David Hooks Construction Services completed a remodel of our home which encompassed the kitchen, living room and one bathroom. The job was completed on time and on budget. Several of our friends rolled their eyes when we said we were going to do a remodel; many tales of horror were then recounted. They didn’t know David and his team.

                  Contractors need to posses knowledge about building: framing wiring, plumbing, etc. many of them do. However, being a competent contractor requires an additional skill set that few, unfortunately, possess. Contractors are essentially managers. They need to be organized and diligent. They need to coordinate and communicate. These are the qualities which set David Hooks apart. He always told us what was going to happen next and when it was going to occur. He communicates with his subcontractors-all of whom where just nice people-in the same way. He gets them to perform like a well tuned orchestra. Last, but not least, David has great people skills. He is a pleasure to work with.

                  <p>I can’t thank you enough for the amazing remodel you did on our home. Having seen your work (and work ethic) before, we knew we’d be in good hands.

                  Remodelling – especially where you have to move out for an extended period-is stressful, and you made sure to deal with that aspect of it with as much care as you did the work itself. Your initial pep talk about what was going to happen and how we might feel during the process was right on, and was a good touchstone to go back to during days when we were tired of living in friends’ guest rooms! You never promised more than you could deliver, which made it much easier to keep our own expectations realistic.

                  I felt like we worked as a great team; Douglas and I certainly had ideas but of course no knowledge about how feasible they’d be. You invariably made them better than we’d imagined. We also appreciated that you made your own suggestions–raising the kitchen ceiling made a huge difference in the end result and we hadn’t even considered it.

                  The attention to detail from both you and your subcontractors was amazing. The tile work, the electrical, the painting, the concrete counter tops, the cabinetry; all of it stunning, a testament to your knowledge of local vendors and who would be best for the job. Add to that, the work site was clean, as quiet as possible, and scheduling was done for maximum cost and time savings. The few small snags we ran into were solved quickly and competently; invariably you had several solutions to offer before we even knew there was a problem to be solved.

                  We could not be happier with the result. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!</p>

                  <p>David and his crew remodelled our deck and added an outdoor kitchen, complete with Viking appliances and a Mugnaini wood fired pizza oven. The Ipe deck, installed at 45 degree angles, was complimented by a Sipo pergola and featured stainless railings.

                  David was always available for consultation and made us feel like special customers. His crew was friendly, neat and focused on quality in every step. I would recommend David for any project, large or small.

                    We hired David Hooks Construction Services for our major kitchen and living room remodel, as well as for the re-siding and insulation installation of our home.

                    David Hooks Construction managed the build out and transition of my bakery to its new location in Watsonville, Ca. Due to the nature of our wholesale business, there was simply no opportunity to ever stop baking as the project got under way. This presented a logistical nightmare, but David showed tremendous skill as he managed the critical time line from start to finish. Every obstacle along the way was met head on and resolved swiftly. David was committed to keeping within the budget and staying on track to make the dead line. His professional workmanship yielded a superb result, on time and on budget. I highly recommend David Hooks for any construction project you have planned, be it commercial or residential. You simply can’t go wrong.

They went out of their way to make sure everything was done right and finished on time. His crew cleaned up every night and arrived on time every day. They were pleasant and easy to have around. taking special care to keep my small dog safe and confined to the house. I highly recommend them.

                    We have contracted with David Hooks and his crew to do work on our town house twice in the last few years, once for an addition over our garage and again for a kitchen and bathroom remodel. They are professional, easy to work with, and great about keeping to schedules. We’ve received wonderful compliments on these improvements from neighbours. We can’t recommend them highly enough. In fact, we miss having them around.

                    David Hooks has done two major remodels for us and I have more planned for the future. I can’t recommend him highly enough. Having done remodels with other contractors in the past, I can attest that David Hooks is a rare find in Santa Cruz. His work is impeccable and beautiful. He is detail oriented but also sees the big picture. He’s got integrity and a great work ethic. If he says he will be there – he will. His crew shares his same work ethic and they are great to work with. I appreciate that David is easy to communicate with and always at the end of a phone, email or text. I also appreciate that I can run my ideas by him and he will come up with a variety of ways to make them work, while keeping my budget in mind. It’s been great working with someone so professional, trust worthy, organized and creative as well. I look forward to working with David Hooks again on our next remodelling project.

                    David and his crew are wonderful to work with. They are honest, trust-worthy, cost-conscious, and do beautiful work. David has a keen eye for design and provides aesthetically beautiful, yet functional suggestions. I can count on him to fulfill his agreements and to use solid, dependable subcontractors. David never hesitates to communicate if there is a problem and will work with me to reach a mutually agreeable solution.

                    I can’t say enough about how great it is to work with David and his crew, and will continue to use his services when I remodel 3 more apartment unit.

                    David did two major remodelling projects on our home, and both were completed on time and on budget. He stays in close communication throughout the project, and provides options for controlling costs while maintaining quality. He and his regular crew were attentive to detail, solved design and installation problems creatively, and always went above and beyond duty to complete each task with the highest level of professionalism. He holds his subcontractors to those same high standards. I worked in the trades for a number of years, and can attest that David stands out for his integrity and his commitment to the highest quality of craftsmanship. I would not hesitate to hire him again for another project, no matter how big or small.
